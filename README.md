# AI Project: Tips Dataset Analysis

This project explores AI techniques using the **Tips dataset**. It implements both a **Neural Network** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to analyze and predict tipping behavior.

## Features

- **Neural Network**: A model trained to understand patterns in tipping amounts.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A classification-based approach to predict tipping trends.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for better predictions.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and insights to understand the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for Neural Network)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the provided scripts to train and test the models:
   - `data_preprocessing.py`: Preprocess the data.
   - `neural_network_model.py`: Train the Neural Network.
   - `knn_model.py`: Train the KNN model.
