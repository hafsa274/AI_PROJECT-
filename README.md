# AI Project: Tips Dataset Analysis

This project applies AI techniques to analyze tipping behavior using the **Tips dataset**. It implements both **Neural Networks** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for prediction.

## Features

- **Neural Network**: Predicts tipping amounts based on input features.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies tipping trends.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for better accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Uses graphs to interpret tipping patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for Neural Network)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hafsa274/AI_PROJECT-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI_PROJECT-
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the provided scripts:
   - `data_preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses the dataset.
   - `neural_network_model.py`: Trains the Neural Network.
   - `knn_model.py`: Trains the KNN model.

## Results & Analysis

This project compares the performance of Neural Networks and KNN in predicting tipping behavior, providing insights into customer tipping patterns.
